# GeoTourguide
GeoTourguide helps you explore archived pages that were originally hosted by the defunct web hosting service, GeoCities. You can select a neighborhood with a dropdown, and when the site directory loads, a list of sites will appear for you to click on. Sites will show on the right. The functionality of these sites are not guaranteed, as some are placeholder sites, some were not archived in their entirety, and some were just broken to begin with.

The default viewing width is 805px in order to prevent their layouts from breaking (all these sites are from an era where low-res 4:3 monitors were king), but you can resize it on the bottom right of the viewer.

GeoTourguide relies on Oocities for its archives. The sites and site listings come from here. Because of the way GeoTourguide fetches the site lists, requests are routed through the CORS Anywhere proxy. If either Oocities or CORS Anywhere are down, the site list will fail to display.
