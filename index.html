        <h1>About GeoTourguide</h1>
        <p>
          GeoTourguide helps you explore archived pages that were originally hosted by the defunct
          web hosting service, GeoCities. You can select a neighborhood with a dropdown, and when the
          site directory loads, a list of sites will appear for you to click on. Sites will show
          on the right. The functionality of these sites are not guaranteed, as some are placeholder
          sites, some were not archived in their entirety, and some were just broken to begin with.
          The width of displayed sites is limited to 805px in order to prevent their layouts from
          breaking (all these sites are from an era where low-res 4:3 monitors were king).
        </p>
        <p>
          GeoTourguide relies on <a href="http://www.oocities.org/">Oocities</a> for its archives.
          The sites and site listings come from here. Because of the way GeoTourguide fetches the
          site lists, requests are routed through the
          <a href="https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/">CORS Anywhere</a> proxy. If either Oocities
          or CORS Anywhere are down, the site list will fail to display.
